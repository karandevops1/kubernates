single pod running our application:
for some reason application crashes and pod fails ,user will no longer will be able to access the application.

so to prevent user from losing access to our application, we should have more than pod running at same time.
if one pod fails we can use another still we can access the application which is running in another pod.

replication controller is used to run multiple instances of same pod in k8s cluster.

replication controller ensures that the specified number of pods are running at all times.

another reason we need replication controller is to create multiple pod to share load across them.

example:
single pod serving a set of users, when number of user increases , we deploy additional pod to balance the load across the 2pods.

if the demand further increases and if we were to run out of resoureces on the first node ,
we could deploy additional pods accross the other nodes in the cluster.

as we can see rc spans accross multiple nodes in cluster.
it helps us balance the load accross multiple pod on different nodes as well as scale our application.
