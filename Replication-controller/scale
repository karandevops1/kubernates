scaling command:

in replicaset number of replica is specified as 3 who to change it as 6:

1) directly in file if we need to modify then modify and use below command:
kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yaml

2) using below command using file name it will not update in file:
kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset-definition.yaml

3)using below command we use type(replicaset) and name(myapp-replicaset):
kubectl scale --replicas=6 replicaset myapp-replicaset

note:
based on load also we can scale it is advanced concept.
