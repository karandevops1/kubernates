Networking in k8s:

single node k8s cluster:
minikube node has ip address eg: 192.168.1.2

inside node , pod is created. 
in docker ip addredd is assigned to docker container.
but in k8s ip address is assigned to pod.
each pod gets its own internall ip address.
laptop ip: 192.168.1.10

pod ip address: 10.244.0.2

how pod gets ip address?
we create an internal private network with the address 10.244.0.2
and all pods are attached.

when we deploy multiple pods , they all get a separate ip address from its network.
