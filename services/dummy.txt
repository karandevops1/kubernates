k8s services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.

k8s services helps us connect application together with other application or users.

example:
we deployed our pod having a web application running on it.
how do we as an external user access the web page?

exesiting setup example:
k8s node has ip address 192.168.1.2
laptop is on the same network as well 192.168.1.10

internal pod network is in the range 10.244.0.0
pod has ip address 10.244.0.2

In most Kubernetes setups, you cannot access a Pod directly via its internal IP (e.g., 10.244.0.2) from outside the cluster,

option to see the web page:

ssh: into node
inside k8s node we can see:
curl http://10.244.0.2
hello world!!

if i want to be able to access the webserver from my own laptop without having to switch into the node and simply by accessing the ip of the k8s node.

so we need something in middle to help us map requests to node from our laptop through the node to the pod running the web container.

this is where k8s services comes into play.
