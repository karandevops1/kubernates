k8s services enables communication between various components within and outside of the application.

k8s services helps us connect application together with other application or users.

example:
we deployed our pod having a web application running on it.
how do we as an external user access the web page?

exesiting setup example:
k8s node has ip address 192.168.1.2
laptop is on the same network as well 192.168.1.10

internal pod network is in the range 10.244.0.0
pod has ip address 10.244.0.2

In most Kubernetes setups, you cannot access a Pod directly via its internal IP (e.g., 10.244.0.2) from outside the cluster,
