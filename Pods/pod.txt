k8s uses yaml file for creation of objects such as:
-pods
-replicas
-deployment
-service

----------------------------------------------------------------
k8s definition file always contains 4 top level fields.
apiVersion:  -> k8s apiversion which is used to create the object. (String value)
kind:        -> represents type of object we are going to Create.  (String value)
metadata:     -> meta data is the data about the object eg: name , labels etc. (Dictionary value) -> key & value format. 
                 name , labels - used to identify object later point of time.
                 ex: 100 pods running frontend application & 100 pods backend application or database.
                 it is difficult to group this pods once they are deployed.
                when we apply labels we can filter later part of time.
spec:        -> specification (provide additional info of object). )  (dictionary value)
------------------------------------------------------------------

api Version for different object:-

kind           Version
POD            V1
Service        v1
ReplicaSet     apps/v1

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 
-> pod can have multiple containers
