example:

we deployed front apllication over 3 pods:
we could like to create replication controller or replication set to ensure that we have 3 active pods running at anytime.
 we can use replicationset to montior existing pods if you have them already created.

the role of replication set is to montior the pods and if any of them were to fail deploy new onces.

how replicationset know which pods to montior?
there could be 100 of pods in cluster.
